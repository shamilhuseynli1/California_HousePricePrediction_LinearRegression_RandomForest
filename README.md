Description:

This repository contains code for predicting house prices in California using two popular machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression and Random Forest. The project explores the performance of these algorithms in predicting house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from California housing market data. Through this project, we aim to compare the effectiveness of linear regression and random forest models in predicting house prices and provide insights into the factors influencing housing prices in California.

Jupyter Notebook: California_HousePricePrediction.ipynb
In this notebook, we compare Linear Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms for predicting house prices in California.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the dataset and visualize key features influencing house prices.
Preprocessing steps, including data cleaning and feature engineering, are implemented.
Models are trained, evaluated, and compared using appropriate metrics.
Insights and conclusions from the analysis are provided.

Note:

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed to run the Jupyter notebook.
The dataset used is included in the repository or can be downloaded from [source].
Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs or extend the analysis.
